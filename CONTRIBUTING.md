# Contributing

Hi! Thank you for the interest in our application. Please, before contributing read this guidelines.

## Commit messages

We use [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

## Editor config

We use `.editorconfig` file to specify all editor related settings.
Your editor should automatically pickup all settings from [this file](.editorconfig)

## Git flow:

We use [git forking flow](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

In order to work with the codebase you should:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Besides `origin` remote (your forked repository) you should add `upsteam` remote.
It should be [original repository](https://github.com/DimaDK24/learning-app)
4. For every piece of work you should create a new branch based on `master`
5. You should often pull commits from `upstream master` into your own.
It's needed to have fresh codebase
6. After you finish some atomic piece of work in the new branch you should push it
to **your** repository. Then create a pull request to the `master` branch of original repository
7. I'll review and merge your pull request.
8. Then you should update your local `master` to reflect changes in it

In case you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask [me](https://t.me/dimadk24)
